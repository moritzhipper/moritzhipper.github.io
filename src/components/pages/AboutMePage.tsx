        I was born in Frankfurt, moved to Stuttgart to study Information
        Technology and have been building my career in Fintech for the past ten
        years. I'm good in coding, connecting with others and sharing my
        knowledge with students and colleagues. I really enjoy bringing my
        creativity into my work.

        When I'm not coding, I'm probably in the nature somewhere looking at
        birds.
