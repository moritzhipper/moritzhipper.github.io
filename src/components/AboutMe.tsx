      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p className="big">
        I was born in Frankfurt, moved to Stuttgart to study Information
        Technology and have been building my career in Fintech for the past ten
        years. I'm good in coding, connecting with others and sharing my
        knowledge with students and colleagues. I enjoy bringing my creativity
        into my work.

        When I'm not doing that, I'm probably in the nature somewhere looking at
        birds.
